Work in progress! Read this [blog post]({% post_url 2014-08-18-smarter_todo_list %}) from a couple of years ago for my thoughts on why I started this project in the first place.

I probably didn't think at the time that I'd still be working on Immedialist, but life conspires. I'm excited to put a more detailed page here some day linking to a real hosted app.
