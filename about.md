<p>From a young age, I knew that I loved two things: writing and helping
people with technology. At Wesleyan University, I pursued my interest in
writing on multiple fronts: editing the campus newspaper, founding a long-form
journalism magazine, and writing short stories. After graduating, I worked in
The New York Times R&D Department, where I took on programming assignments and
learned that I wanted to spend the rest of my life coding.</p>

<p>My first job as a software engineer at Continuity was an incredible
experience. I discovered the immense value of test-driven development and pair
programming and began developing my instincts for good object design and
pragmatic architecture choices. I will carry with me for the rest of my career
the lessons I learned form my senior engineer mentors.</p>

<p>Besides programming, I have been immensely enjoying designing board games
with my friend during my spare time. It was been wonderful discovering the
many parallels between that process and the day-to-day activities of a
software engineer, as well as watching others (hopefully) enjoy the games
I've made. I also am working on and off on a science fiction novel
about artificial intelligence that I hope to finish some day.</p>
