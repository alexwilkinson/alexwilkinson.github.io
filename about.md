<p>From a young age, I knew that I loved two things: writing and working with
technology. At Wesleyan University, I pursued my interest in writing on
multiple fronts: editing the campus newspaper, founding a long-form journalism
magazine, and writing short stories. After graduating, I worked in The New York
Times R&D Department, where I took on programming assignments and learned that
I wanted to start a career as a Software Engineer. In order to do so, I left
the Times to attend the Web Development Immersive course at the Flatiron
School, a bootcamp-style education that prepared me very well to become a
working programmer.</p>

<p>My first job as a Software Engineer at Continuity was an incredible
experience. I discovered the immense value of test-driven development and pair
programming and began developing my instincts for good object design and
pragmatic architecture choices. I will carry with me for the rest of my career
the lessons I learned from my senior engineer mentors.</p>

<p>Besides programming, I have been immensely enjoying designing board games.
It has been wonderful discovering the many parallels between that process and
the day-to-day activities of a software engineer, as well as watching others
(hopefully) enjoy the games I've made. I also am working on and off on a
science fiction novel about artificial intelligence that I hope to finish some
day.</p>
