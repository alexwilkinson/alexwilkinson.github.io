<p>From a young age, I knew that I loved two things: writing and working with
technology. At Wesleyan University, I pursued my interest in writing on
multiple fronts: editing the campus newspaper, founding a long-form journalism
magazine, and writing short stories. After graduating, I spend all my spare
time going through online programming tutorials and realized that I wanted to
start a career as a Software Engineer. In order to do so, I attend the Web
Development Immersive course at the Flatiron School, a bootcamp-style education
that prepared me very well to become a working programmer.</p>

<p>I worked as a Rails Developer at Continuity for 2 years, and I currently
work as an iOS Developer at SeeClickFix. I also have experience writing Ember
apps, and am building a React Native app for a personal project.</p>

<p>When I'm not programming or hanging out with my fiancee and my adorable
black cat, I spend my time designing board games. It has been exciting
discovering the many parallels between that process and the day-to-day
activities of a software engineer, as well as watching others (hopefully) enjoy
the games I've made. I also am working on and off on a science fiction novel
about artificial intelligence that I hope to finish some day.</p>
